# buhr.dev or buhr.design – Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [GSAP](www.gsap.com). It showcases selected deep dives into projects, demos, and visuals that reflect how I approach design and code.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
- **Language**: Typescript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animations**: GSAP
- **Hosting**: Vercel

## Features

- Responsive layout
- Dynamic routing for case studies
- Slick animations
- Modular component architecture with reusable design patterns
- Built from scratch, no templates
- Used Cursor for assistance

## Why I built this

I wanted full control over how I present my work—both in terms of layout and motion. I also used this as a way to get deeper into front-end development and refine my skills in React, layout systems, and animation frameworks.

## What’s next

- Adding more code-driven experiments
- Improving accessibility
- Getting better at animation and learning procedural animations
