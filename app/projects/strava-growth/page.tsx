                We fixed the experiment backlog to solve real problems, grew
                subscriptions, and didn&rsquo;t wreck the product doing it.

                As the first designer on a newly established subscription growth
                team, I helped shift our approach by reverse engineering backlog
                ideas into human problems, collaborating with research to run
                ideation sessions along the athlete journey. Alongside building
                smarter growth experiments, I also made sure our work respected
                the overall product, working within an existing design system
                and partnering with designers to form new patterns. My
                contributions helped drive ~$6.3M in annual subscription growth
                revenue.
