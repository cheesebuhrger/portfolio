                  Buhr is talented far beyond his title.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  He joined Buildforce as a Staff Product Designer focused on
                  bringing our SaaS product to life. It wasn&apos;t long before
                  I realized I needed to get out of the way, let him do his
                  thing, and promote him to Head of Design. He greatly impacted
                  design, design processes, how product operated and evolved,
                  and overall team dynamics. When he joined, things were a bit
                  chaotic, and he brought balance and much-needed structure to
                  our team. He did this all while elevating our design, brand,
                  and overall experience of Buildforce.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  He set the structure and processes for managing designers at
                  Buildforce. He had a thoughtful approach and consistently
                  managed and mentored another product designer. Under his
                  leadership, they were able to grow and understand where to
                  grow and focus.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Moreover, Buhr is the best designer I&apos;ve had the
                  privilege to work with. His skill set is remarkably diverse,
                  spanning product design, marketing/growth, brand design, and
                  more. There is no task he couldn&apos;t handle.
                  <br />
                  <br />I consider myself lucky to have had the opportunity to
                  work with him, and I hope to have the chance to work with him
                  again in the future.

                  Buhr is one of the most talented designers and product minds I
                  have encountered in my 10 years working as a software
                  engineer. His ability to isolate and solve customer problems
                  with simple, focused and beautiful UX is unparalleled. At
                  Buildforce I watched Buhr take a scattered brand and transform
                  it into something unique and consistent -- all within the span
                  of a few months. As if that weren&apos;t enough, shortly after
                  its release Buhr was able to to make contributions to our
                  production codebase and release UI changes that may have never
                  been prioritized by a busy engineering team.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  When encountering technical hurdles, Buhr is quick to
                  collaborate. We often came up with creative design
                  alterations, keeping engineering pace high. As a result, we
                  loved having Buhr in the room because it meant our scoping,
                  critiquing, or ideating would result in a higher quality
                  feature in less time.

                  Buhr&apos;s impact on Buildforce was undeniable from the
                  moment he joined the team. He wasn&apos;t just another hire;
                  he rolled up his sleeves and helped us define and establish
                  design processes that are still the backbone of our workflow
                  today. He also played a key role in facilitating and shaping
                  our product roadmap, ensuring design remained at the forefront
                  of every decision. His passion for fostering a strong design
                  culture was infectious, creating a space where collaboration
                  and innovation thrived across product, design, and
                  engineering.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Buhr&apos;s leadership went beyond just the technical aspects.
                  He spearheaded the development of our design systems and brand
                  identity, ensuring a consistent experience for all our
                  products. But what truly sets Buhr apart is his ability to
                  connect with people. He&apos;s a fantastic listener who asks
                  insightful questions and acts as a skilled mediator, fostering
                  open communication and bridging gaps between teams with his
                  genuine curiosity and collaborative spirit. He wasn&apos;t
                  just my manager; he was a mentor who generously shared his
                  knowledge and helped shape my professional journey.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Buhr&apos;s a rare combination of design expertise,
                  collaborative spirit, and a genuinely positive and curious
                  personality. He&apos;s an invaluable asset to any
                  organization, and I highly recommend him for any design
                  leadership role where his skills and experience can truly
                  shine. It was an absolute privilege to get to work with and
                  know this wonderful human being.
